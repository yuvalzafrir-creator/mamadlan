# B2B Marketplace Engagement — Implementation Progress & Handoff

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Branch:** `feat/b2b-marketplace-engagement`
**Status:** ✅ All 21 tasks complete + whole-branch code review done + merge-blocking fixes applied. Ready to finish (merge/PR). Automated verification green; manual browser smoke against the production DB still pending user go-ahead.

## Reference documents
- **Design spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement-design.md](specs/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement-design.md)
- **Implementation plan (full code for every task):** [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement.md](plans/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement.md)

## What this feature is
A B2B engagement layer (request-for-quote, structured quotes with counter-offers, anonymized admin-moderated negotiation, offline close + commission) layered on top of the existing consumer shelter marketplace. The consumer Stripe flow is untouched. Business buyers self-declare via an `is_business` flag on `users`. Model: **matchmaker + commission**, hybrid routing (admin qualifies → shortlists sellers → sellers quote → admin approves → buyer accepts/counters), anonymized buyer↔seller thread to protect commission from disintermediation.

## Execution method
Subagent-Driven Development (superpowers): per task, a fresh implementer subagent implements + tests + commits, followed by review. Security-sensitive tasks (anonymization, quote transitions, messages) received an extra spec-compliance review.

`HEAD` is currently at `6ce0999`.

## Final review outcome
Whole-branch review (`92511c5..434b661`) found the authorization model sound and PII anonymization holding end-to-end (no raw name/phone/email/user-id leaks on any buyer- or seller-reachable endpoint). Four merge-blockers were fixed in `6ce0999`:
- **C1** buyer quote list now uses the shared `sellerAlias()` so labels match the thread.
- **I1** seller counter-response passes `parent_quote_id`, keeping the quote chain linked.
- **I2** `COALESCE` on `deal_value`/`commission_amount` so a status-only PATCH can't wipe a recorded deal.
- **I3** shortlisting now advances a still-`new` request to `quoting`.

Deferred minors (safe follow-ups): block messages on closed/cancelled requests (M1); hide the listing "request a quote" CTA from the listing's own seller/admins (M2); skip quote approval on cancelled requests (M3).

## Verification results
- `npm run build`: ✅ compiles; all B2B routes registered.
- B2B unit tests: ✅ 31/31 pass.
- Repo-wide `npm test`: 2 failures in `__tests__/api/listings.test.ts` — **pre-existing, unrelated** (the working-tree `lib/listings.ts` dropped its dimensions check before this session; B2B never touched that file). Also surfaces duplicated from a stale leftover worktree at `.claude/worktrees/mystifying-kare-e260a9/`.
- Manual browser smoke (plan Task 21 Step 3): **not run** — it writes test rows and `DATABASE_URL` points at production Neon. Awaiting user go-ahead.

## Files created so far

**Pure logic (unit-tested):** `lib/b2b/types.ts`, `lib/b2b/validation.ts`, `lib/b2b/state.ts`, `lib/b2b/alias.ts`, `lib/b2b/anonymize.ts`
**Tests:** `__tests__/lib/b2b/{validation,state,alias,anonymize}.test.ts` (31 new tests, all passing)
**Auth:** `requireBusiness()` added to `lib/auth.ts`; `is_business` threaded through `auth.ts`
**API routes:** `app/api/account/business/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/requests/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/requests/[id]/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/requests/[id]/sellers/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/requests/[id]/messages/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/quotes/route.ts`, `app/api/b2b/quotes/[id]/route.ts`
**Pages/UI:** `app/b2b/page.tsx` (landing), homepage B2B section in `app/page.tsx`, nav link in `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` (`navLinks` array, `{ href: '/b2b', label: 'רכש לארגונים' }`)
**Migration:** `scripts/schema.sql` + `scripts/migrate.mjs` (already run against the live Neon DB — additive/idempotent)

## Notes & decisions made during implementation
- **Task 10:** Implementer added `void` statements after the PII-stripping destructure (harmless clarity tweak). PII stripping via rest-spread verified correct.
- **Task 13:** Counter-offer `notes` field falls back to `null` (not the original quote's notes) — **deliberate**: `notes` is an author-specific comment, unlike price/units/delivery which are commercial terms that carry over. Accepted as-is.
- **Task 14:** Spec-reviewed — confirmed no PII leak for non-admin (allow-list `anonymizeMessage`), stable seller alias index (ordered by `invited_at`).
- **Build:** every task verified with `npm run build` (ESLint disabled during builds in this project). All green through Task 16.

## Remaining work — Tasks 17–21

Full, copy-paste-ready code for each is in the plan file:
[docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement.md](plans/2026-06-08-b2b-marketplace-engagement.md)

### Task 17 — Sourcing form
- Create `app/b2b/request/page.tsx` (client form posting to `POST /api/b2b/requests`).
- **Important:** the plan code uses a CSS class `input`. First verify whether `.input` exists (`grep -rn "\.input" app/globals.css`) and look at `app/seller/listings/new/page.tsx` for how its inputs are styled. If `.input` does NOT exist, replace each `className="input w-full"` with the exact input className used in the seller new-listing form. (This check was the in-flight step when the session ended.)

### Task 18 — Buyer portal
- `app/b2b/requests/page.tsx` (list), `app/b2b/requests/[id]/page.tsx` (detail), `app/b2b/requests/[id]/BuyerQuoteActions.tsx`, `components/b2b/QuoteThread.tsx`.
- Buyer detail shows only `approved`/`accepted` quotes with seller alias (`ספק {idx+1}`), accept/reject actions, and the thread. (Counter-offer UI is added in Task 20 Step 7.)
- Apply the same `.input` class check as Task 17 for `QuoteThread` and any inputs.

### Task 19 — Admin console
- `app/admin/b2b/page.tsx` (queue), `app/admin/b2b/[id]/page.tsx` (detail), `app/admin/b2b/[id]/AdminRequestActions.tsx`.
- Add a dashboard card/link to `/admin/b2b` in `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` (match existing card pattern).
- Apply the `.input` class check.

### Task 20 — Seller views + listing CTA + counter-offer UI
- `app/seller/b2b/page.tsx`, `app/seller/b2b/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/seller/b2b/[id]/SellerQuoteForm.tsx`, `components/b2b/RequestQuoteButton.tsx`.
- Mount `RequestQuoteButton` on `app/listings/[id]/page.tsx` near the buy CTA (pass `listingId`, `shelterType`, `location` — match the page's actual `listing` variable).
- Add a `/seller/b2b` card to `app/seller/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- Replace `BuyerQuoteActions.tsx` with the counter-offer-enabled version (Task 20 Step 7 in the plan).
- Apply the `.input` class check.

### Task 21 — Verification
- `npm test` (all suites), `npm run build`.
- Manual smoke (dev server, preview tools): buyer submits request → admin shortlists seller → seller quotes → admin approves → buyer sees alias-only quote, counters, accepts → messages show aliases to buyer/seller, raw to admin.

## How to resume
1. `git checkout feat/b2b-marketplace-engagement` (verify `HEAD` = `ef317e3`).
2. Continue Subagent-Driven Development from **Task 17**, using the full task code in the plan file.
3. Remember the cross-cutting `.input` CSS-class check for every UI task (17–20).
4. Dispatch tasks sequentially (never in parallel — shared git index).
5. After Task 21, run a final whole-branch code review, then use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to decide merge/PR.

## Open items deferred (from spec §12 / reviews)
- Notifications (email on new request/quote/message) — out of scope v1; users poll dashboards.
- Optional DB indexes on `b2b_*` FK columns (`request_id`, `buyer_id`) — fine to add later under load.
- `deal_value`/`commission_amount` units = shekels (integer), matching `listings.price`.
